# Hypothesis-Testing-using-NHANES-Data-with-Python




In this notebook we demonstrate formal hypothesis testing using the [NHANES](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes/index.htm) data.

It is important to note that the NHANES data are a "complex survey".  The data are not an independent and representative sample from the target population.  Proper analysis of complex survey data should make use of additional information about how the data were collected.  Since complex survey analysis is a somewhat specialized topic, we ignore this aspect of the data here, and analyze the NHANES data as if it were an independent and identically distributed sample from a population.
