      "The worth Airline you can fly with:\n",
      "\tI traveled through Asia during 22 days and flew with 8 different Airlines companies. I did not have any problem with my luggage with 7 Airlines (Qatar x2, Lion Air x2, Sriwijaya Air (Nam Air), Batik Air Malaysia, Bangkok Airways x2, Cambodia Angkor Air, Smile (Thai Airways) Swiss x2). It has been totally different with AirAsia, it is the only company that asked me to pay a fee!! While the price for 2 tickets was  46.66 CHF (=53 USD) with checked luggage included up to 2x20 Kg (40 Kg). I had to pay additional 83.73 CHF (=96 USD, almost twice the price of the ticket) for 1 bag of 23 Kg + 1 bag of 12 Kg + 1 bag of 10 Kg, equivalent to an excess of 5 Kg. 83.73 NCHF for 5 Kg of luggage, I just call that way of acting like stealing!!! It is a bit like with EasyJet in Europe, they attract customer with very low price, but then you have to pay a lot for everything they oblige you to pay! This company must definitely be avoided if you want to have a nice trip without excessive and unacceptable additional high fees to pay.\n",

      "WORST EXPERIENCE WITH AIRASIA SUPER APP AND “BO” CHATBOT:\n",
      "\tWorst customer service. The chat with Bo is a totally useless app and airasia even has the audacity to direct customer support to this virtual chatbot. Yes a lot of companies are having virtual chatbot now. But airasia is by far the WORST.  1) The chatbot doesn’t even seem to have intelligent AI built into it. Feels like a complete robot replying template answers to customer.  2) Answers and replies in a way that INFURIATES customers instead of helping.  3) customer Receives ZERO help from the chatbot. 4) Makes customer even more angry after using it.  5) no real life customer service support option available.   if any company wants to invent a chatbot that could pissed off all their customers, then AIRASIA are no doubt the champion.   On a side note, airasia announced the change of plane (larger premium flexbed plane to a smaller plane with no flexbed) less than 24hrs before my family is flying. They sent the email around 1am, After the announcement, no calls were made to the customers and basically acts like nothing has happened. We booked the flight because of the premium flexbed option. Was shocked that they can suddenly change the customer preference in such a short notice. The submitting and processing of refund is a NIGHTMARE on the airasia app.  App is either not responding, poor interface, or brings you to some unintended page or not updated with the information entered..   honestly don’t know what is wrong with airasia’s “super” app and chatbot so subpar and low quality. Should let everyone knows how the quality of the airline.\n",
