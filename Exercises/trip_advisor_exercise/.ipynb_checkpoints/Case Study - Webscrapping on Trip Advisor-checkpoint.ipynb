      "Not good:\n",
      "\tThere is No food to speak of only the basics which you have to purchase as an extra. There is No alcoholic drinks. The seats are very narrow and I only have a 32 inch waste. Our connecting Flight  from Phuket to Kuala Lumpa was changed from 7.20pm evening to 8.10 in the morning of the same day and we were only given 8 hours notice. They do not have a call centre in any country and the only way you can try to contact them is through there website and they do not answer you still waiting for answers to our emails. Instead of having an hour stop over we had 12 hours plus it took a  hole day off our holiday. The young lady at the airport who was at the Air asia desk could not contact them for us and we still have no Idea why the flight were changed. We were in premium economy which is about the same size and leg room as standard domestic on any other airline. Hope this helps who you choose your  airline. No explanation has been given\n",
